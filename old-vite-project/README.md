# Coffee Tracker

## TODO
I'm adding a font nunito to redesign the card (talking with bard about it)
Using a repo service (supabase) do the next with the tasks
- get
- create
- delete
- update

## Web component structure
- base HTML with innerHTML
- query components
- create components
- dynamic content
- handlers
- styles

## How can I improve the dirty MVP?
- DONE remove shadown dom
- use the same pattern for each web component
  - move selectors to the beginning of the method
- generic styles in the root
