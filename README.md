# Life Task Manager

## TO DO
- start planning functionality for 2 special task attributes
    - planning: range of time to do a task

## Tech learnings
- Radix UI theme is hard to personalized to specific colors or sizes. Maybe primitives may be a solution.

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
